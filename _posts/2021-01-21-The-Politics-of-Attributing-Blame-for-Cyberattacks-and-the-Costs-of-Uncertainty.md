**Precis**: "What is missing [in attribution research] is a sense of the broader political implications of attributional uncertainty, especially when it comes to how this affects the general public" (p. 954-5). "Attributions play a central role in shaping the public’s policy preferences when it comes to responding to threats and guarding against them in the future [...] Attributions are especially salient if cyberattacks cause a policy shift or an escalation of hostilities" (p. 955).

**Details**:

- "when it comes to cyberattacks, the evidence is often absent, ambiguous, tightly controlled by gatekeepers, or shrouded in doubt and technical jargon" (p. 954)
- There is a "prospect of elites opportunistically making attributional claims to justify their policy choices [...] elite framing and misplaced blame are well documented processes, and not unique to cyberattacks" (p. 955)
- Two dangers: (1) initial blame frames are difficult to update with new information (2) attributional uncertainty undermines democratic accountability - if you don't know who to blame you can't determine effective responses
- On uncertainty: "First, cyberattacks do not take place within a clear battlespace and rarely arrive from an identifiable source [...] Second, investigating attacks is time consuming and expensive [...] Third, investigation is a complex process that must be done collectively [...] Finally, cyberattacks raise the 'many hands' problem of determining specific individuals’ contributions" (p. 956)
- On partisan actors: "Partisan and nationalistic biases could also shape the causal accounts developed, as well as influencing which narrative is endorsed by interested political actors" (p. 956)
- On going beyond elites: "This existing research on attributing cyberattacks is invaluable, yet it is limited by a focus on elite decision-making processes like deterring future attacks, retaliating against aggressors, and building more effective defenses. To develop a stronger grasp of cyberattacks’ political consequences, it is essential to go beyond the elite focus to consider how responsibility attributions affect citizens’ perceptions of security issues" (p. 957)
- On sense making: "attributions matter because they are vital for making sense of political phenomena" (p. 957)
- On norms: "One way that communities constitute themselves is through a collective enforcement of norms. Above all, this depends on being able to clearly point to those who have transgressed the norms. When punishment is impossible, assigning blame can at least restore a sense of moral certainty and confidence in the norms and the security they are supposed to provide" (p. 957)
- On policy change: "Attribution is also vital for building international solidarity and support for major policy changes" (p. 957)
- Four consequences of search to assign blame without requisite information:
  - Increased reliance of information framed by a relatively small number of elites: "the public must draw conclusions from reports that are offered by a small number of policymakers and security professionals involved in the investigation [...] competition between frames is restricted by a lack of information that limits access to counter-frames." (p. 958) e.g. 2003 power outages blamed on Chinese hackers, but turned out to be trees. 
  - Blame feedback loops: "Blame feedback loops occur when attacks are explained in terms of existing hostilities and then become accepted as evidence of those hostilities that may influence subsequent threat perceptions."(p. 959). There is a risk of path-dependence: "it constrains us to interpreting novel events in terms of past events, entrenching hostilities even when they might otherwise subside and obscuring emergent threats" (p. 960). e.g. 1998 DoD network attack attributed to Iraq but actually teenages in California, Canada and Israel. 2013 TV5 false flagged as Islamic State affiliate but more likely Russia.
  - Conspiratorial thinking: "with fewer facts available, it is more difficult to say whether frames related to cyberattacks are conspiratorial in the sense of being false" (p. 962). "The ultimate cost of conspiratorial thinking may be an increased incidence of false alarms, growing doubt for official explanations of real attacks resembing those false alarrms, and increased difficulty in forming a consensus about the presence or absence of threats to national security" (p. 962-3)
  - Decline of democratic accountability: "Exercising popular sovereignty presupposes that citizens have relevant information about who is responsible for major events [...] Unfortunately, effective cybersecurity may require states to rely morer heavily on deception, exacerbating attribution difficulties both in the sense of the public seeing who is responsible for launching attacks and for judging elected officials' decisions" (p. 963). 
- Conclusions
  - "efforts to assign blame are essential for making sense of security issues, forming policy preferences, and exercising popular sovereignty. Attributions must continue to be at the heart of political judgment, even as new challenges emerge to obscure this process" (p. 964)

**Directions**: 

- "Political scientists can play a role in this by exploring how these novel threats fit into what previous research has uncovered about opinion formation and conflict processes. Future research should continue to investigate the political challenges associated with attribution and to consider what additional steps could be taken to manage this problem" (p 964)
