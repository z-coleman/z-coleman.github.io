### Mapping the Known Unknowns of Cybersecurity Education: A Review of Syllabi on Cyber Conflict and Security

[doi](https://doi.org/10.1080/15512169.2020.1729166)

**Authors**: Trey Herr (Atlantic Council), Arthur Laudrain (Oxford), Max Smeets (ETH Zurich)

**Precis**: “there is no canon in the [IR sub]field of cyber conflict” (p. 9):  “two students at different universities could read 30+ articles in their semester-long courses and not overlap on a single work” (p. 6). 

**Method**: review of 32 syllabi on cyber education, graduate and undergraduate (65 collected). Multiple syllabi from same Uni accepted. 27 / 32 syllabi from US. 1,127 observations. The intended purpose of readings is unclear (e.g. revealing misconceptions).

**Details**: Top 3 (1) Cybersecurity and Cyber War: What Everyone Needs to Know (Peter Singer and Allan Friedman, 2014) (2) Cyber War Will Not Take Place (Thomas Rid, 2012/13) (3) APT1: Exposing One of China’s Espionage Units (Mandiant, 2013). Main concepts and methodologies: Cyber power, Deterrence. Main threat actors and attribution: China, Russia. Not routinely present: NATO, cyber proliferation, research methods for IR-cyber.

**Directions**: Consider reports from cybersecurity firms (just 3.35% of material). Avoid overreliance on Stuxnet (the WWI of cybersecurity research) – try Nitro Zeus, Shamoon 1 and 2, or something else from http://apt.threattracking.com.
