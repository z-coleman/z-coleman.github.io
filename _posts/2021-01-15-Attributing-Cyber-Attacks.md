**Precis**: "attribution is what states make of it [...] On a technical level, attribution is an art as much as a science [...] On an operational level, attribution is a nuanced process, not a simple problem [...]  On a strategic level, attribution is a function of what is at stake politically" (p. 7).

**Methodology**: presents model, a 'conceptual and practical map'. "Illustate[s ...] through recent examples (p. 8).

**Details**:

- Stakes: "doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state’s credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately its liberty and its security" (p. 4).
- Part I
  - Policy question: "If an intrusion did not cause any obvious damage, a company or even a government agency may decide to ignore it, to only partially investigate it, or perhaps to improve its defences generally but not launch an expensive investigation into the origins of the seemingly inconsequential breach" (p. 10).
  - Goals: "The tactical goal is understanding the incident primarily in its tech- nical aspects, the how. The operational goal is understanding the attack’s high-level architecture and the attacker’s profile — the what. The strategic goal is understanding who is responsible for the attack, assessing the attack’s rationale, significance, appropriate response — the who and why. Finally communication is also a goal on its own: communicating the outcome of a labour-intensive forensic investigation is part and parcel of the attribution process, and should not be treated as low priority" (p. 10).
  - Levels: "A technical forensic question may be narrowly focused and concretely answerable. Competing operational hypotheses may be informed by labour-intensive forensic evaluations, but not fully backed by the available technical and non-technical evidence. On a strategic level conclusions are yet further removed from forensic artefacts, and may contain a significant amount of assumptions and judgement" (p. 11).
  - Aperture: the scope of sources that can be brought to bear on a specific investigation. "The significance of all-source intelligence and of a wider aperture is one of the strongest reasons why states with highly capable intelligence agencies are better equipped to master the attribution process than even highly capable private entities" (p. 12). Author communication and focus groups in footnotes 19/21/33.
  - Individuals: "If evidence can be produced that links an intrusion to an individual within an organisation, then the attribution will be stronger" (p. 12), but "the ultimate goal of attribution is identifying an organisation or government, not individuals" (p. 13) e.g. cpyy to Chen Ping to PLA (2014).
- Part II
  - Technical: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).  Movement e.g. Ouroboros code contained 'EU Energy Dialogue' as a search term (2014). Equipment reuse e.g. US indictment of PLA (2014). Mistakes e.g. Hector Monsegur (Anonymous), forgot to use Tor and revealed his IP once. Oversight e.g. Stuxnet "‘very much had the feel to it of having been written by or governed by a team of Washington lawyers’ because of its target verification procedures" (Richard Clarke)
  - Operational: hard-to-get details or zero days e.g. Stuxnet. Grouping as APTs. May evolve e.g. supply chain RSA's SecurID system to access Lockheed Martin. Insider threats e.g. Saudi Aramco.
  - Strategic: it is harder to quantify more indirect and delayed costs. Intent and rationale is hard: "A cyber attack that causes a minor power outage could be a warning shot, a failed attempt at a major strategic network breach, or an inadvertent result of reconnaissance" (p. 25). Cyber is 'new' so firsts are common and analysing precendent is difficult. 
  - Summary: "Forensic experts are closest to the most tangible evidence, in the form of log files and lines of code. Operational analysts draw on this work alongside other sources. At the strategic level, policy-makers and high-level analysts can provide great benefits to the process as a whole by probing the competing hypotheses produced by the lower levels. Stress-testing the analysis can reveal flimsy assumptions, a lack of imagination, and group-think" (p. 26).
- Part III
  - "Publicising intelligence can harm sources as well as methods. Release decisions are difficult, and officials will often err on the side of caution and secrecy. There are many good reasons for doing so. Yet, perhaps counter-intuitively for those steeped in a culture of secrecy, more openness has three critical benefits: communicating more details means improved credibility, improved attribution, and improved defences" (p. 26). e.g. DOJ indictment of 5 PLA.
  - Companies: "The market forr attribution has grown significantly: the most useful and detailed attribution reports that are publicly available are published by companies, not governments" (p. 28).
  - Hawthorne: "Publicity often affects the publicised activity itself" (p. 29) with activities slowing, stopping, or shutting down.
  - Language: "Public communication finally has to reflect that attribution is gradual, not absolute.  Security firms and governments therefore should heed a well-established practice: using words of estimative probability" (p. 30).

**Directions**:

- "A closer look the limits of attribution is crucial" (p. 32). The quality of attribution is a function of available resources, and of the adversary's sophistication.
- "The scholarly literature in political science and international relations would significantly benefit from more attention to technical details and limitations" (p. 33).
