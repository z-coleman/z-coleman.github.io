**Speaker**: Ciaran Martin (Oxford and KCL, former Chief Exec NCSC)

**Year**: 2020

**Precis**: "We must start from a robust assertion of three principles about our place as open, liberal democratic societies in the cyber domain and the cyber environment. The first is the primacy of cyber defence. The second is the pursuit of a safer Internet and safer technology as a clear policy goal. The third, flowing from the first two, is that in developing offensive capabilities, and contemplating their use, liberal, democratic nation states should exercise great caution, particularly the further up the scale they go. In the foreseeable future, their efficacy is in promoting digital public safety and security in support of a healthier digital environment" (p. 13).

**Details**:

- Cyber is an environment: "the domain of [military / national security] operations and the domain of peaceful [mundane] activity are inseparable" (p. 3).
- Cyber attacks may be more analagous to a virus than a precision weapon: Wannacry and NotPetya "both [...] involved the attacker losing control of the virus they had released and causing untold and unintended damage" (p. 4).
- Proposes a model for "how liberal democracies should think about the development and possible use of cyber capabilities" (p. 8): HACKS
  - Hacking - specific national defence objectives
  - Adversarial Infastructure destruction - adversarial digital infrastructure destruction (persistent engagement in US, counter-cyber in UK). "It is not concerned with sending a general 'message' to the adversary [...] operational details are seldom given" (p. 7)
  - Counter-influencing - digital harassment i.e. "doing unto them what they tend to do to us" (p. 7) or prepositioning
  - Kinetic - to achieve significant and painful disruption to adversary, beyond direct and recriprocal disruption of a threat e.g. Russia to Kiev 2014, Russia to TV5 Monde 2015
  - Systems wide - all-out conflict, military and civilian 

- Why engage like this?

  1. defend against specific national security threats. This is 'H'. "These types of capabilities are used more and more against serious organised criminals. Good" (p. 9).

  2. deterring cyber attacks. "Here the evidence is decidedly mixed. By that
      I don’t mean it’s inconclusive: I mean in some areas it clearly works and in others it clearly doesn’t" (p. 9). This is 'A'. It doesn't work as a psychological deterrent.
- "In all my operational experience, I saw absolutely nothing to suggest that the existence of Western cyber capabilities, or our willingness to use them, deters attackers. Nor have I seen any convincing research" (p. 9). 
     
- "We would do better to recognise that our societies are organised differently from those of our adversaries" (p. 10)
     
3. a projection of wider state power. 
  
   - Is it clear we want this? "Is an attack on the power supply of another country something we will be willing to contemplate? [...]  for now, I suspect there is sufficient doubt over this to cast a question over the credibility [of prepositioning on a hostile state's critical infrastructure] as a projection of state power" (p. 10).
  
   - If we do, are we sure we can use it as planned? "in these circumstances we would be releasing very destructive, very potent capabilities into the digital environment. Are we sure we can target them properly? Are we confident they can’t just be caught and fired back at our own civilian infrastructure? If they are, can we protect against them?" (p. 11)
  
3b. Have we considered the risks of projecting state power in this way?
  
- security capabilities: "it is irresponsible for Governments to plan on the basis that they can develop and store cyber capabilities on the assumption that they will never leak or be stolen" (p. 11)
  - controling capability once used: "Put simply, what if the West did a NotPetya?" (p. 11)
  - balancing capabilities: "The practical risk calculation for
     a developed, open market, rule of law democracy is clearly in favour of prioritising defence" (p. 12)

**Directions**:

- On attribution: "All I will say is that there was the usual discussion about how we detected it, what the risks to the UK were, the mitigations, the case for public attribution (the efficacy of that is a discussion for another day) and, importantly for this discussion, the consideration of response options and discussions of our own cyber capabilities. In other words, the classic playbook" (p. 2).
- On future risks: " the world’s experience of cyber attacks so far has been one of chronic, debilitating damage rather than catastrophic risk to life and limb. That is likely to remain the case" (p. 4).
- On cyber as nuclear: "most experts now rightly reject the analogy between cyber capabilities and nuclear weapons" (p. 5).
- On cyber as chemical/biological: "would we ever hear anyone argue 'we should have the best biochemical capabilities in the world?'" (p. 5).
- On weaponisation: "Just because authoritarian states have extended their harassment of us into the digital domain doesn’t mean we should, or have to, automatically accept the weaponisation of cyberspace" (p. 12).
- On grey zone: "It is, to me, far from proven that escalating tensions in the so-called grey zone is an effective way of doing this" (p. 12).
