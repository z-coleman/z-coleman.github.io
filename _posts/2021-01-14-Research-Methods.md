[doi]([10.31235/osf.io/fc6sg](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fc6sg))

**Year**: 2019

**Authors**: Robert Gorwa (Oxford, PhD candidate), Max Smeets (ETH)

**Precis**: "the [cyber conflict] field has perhaps focused on theoretical work at the expense of empirical work, and that cyber conflict scholarship has yet to fully draw upon the broader debates on case selection, case study research, and quantitative/qualitative work that have taken place in political methodology in the last two decades" (p. 1).

**Method**: bibliometric analysis - thematic and methodological - of all cyber conflict articles in a top 100 polsci journal between 1990-2018. 147 articles in search. bibliometrix R package.

**Details**:

Thematic

- "cyber conflict remains to be a relatively small field within Political Science [...] even compared to other emerging fields within Political Science (such as climate politics and governance), cyber conflict articles appear to be relatively less cited" (p. 6).
- "In our dataset of academic articles, 2010-2015 appears to be the golden age of 'cyberwar' scholarship, including Thomas Rid's eventual article (and book) that sought to push back against the cyberwar hype. These more critical scholars appear to have been to some degree successful, as the term appears to have fallen out of favour since 2016" (p. 10).

Methodological 

- 9/70 articles explicitly discuss use of methods / research design section (p. 12) - possibly due to theoretical rather than empirical journal style
- Most (39) articles were theory building. 14 were descriptive - no framework or causal mechanism, but to describe operation or state of affairs (p. 13)
- Empirical data: "the problem is that much of the (public) reporting by these firms is done for marketing reasons and remains political: indeed, few have reported on Western operations" (p. 13). Although footnote 29 notes Kaspersky lab do work here.
- Interviews: used as extra resource (e.g. Rid/Buchanan) rather than qualitative research design.
- Case studies: Small set of case studies - Estonia, Georgia, Stuxnet, Sony. 7/16 justified case selection. "The most common approach in our dataset was to simply marshal examples support their argument" (p. 18).

**Directions**:

- On attribution: "our analysis suggests that, many topics, such as proliferation and attribution, widely considered key themes in the literature, have not really recieved lengthy, repeated attention" (p. 9).
- On deterrence: "Many of the published articles in our corpus argue that whilst it is more difficult to deter cyberattacks, there are ways policymakers can dissuade actors from attacking" (p. 11).
- On IR: "the strain of literature on applying IR theory to cyber conflict issues may have dried up (no articles since 2016)" (p. 12).
- On methodology: "Only 17 [of 70] articles at least partially sought to find evidence to confirm or refute a theory" (p. 13).
