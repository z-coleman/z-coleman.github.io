**Year**: 2021

**Author**: Ciaran Martin (Oxf, KCL)

**Precis**: "The slogan of Western cyber policy [is] that 'we will impose costs to deter our adversaries' (or variants of these words)" (para. 3). "There isn’t some ‘menu’ of options for ‘imposing costs’ that we’ve all just been too lazy or timid to order from. Beware, in particular, the snake-oil sales pitch of offensive cyber as a deterrent" (para 28). "The U.S. has suffered one of the worst cyber breaches in its history, orchestrated by a principal adversary, and this awesome offensive arsenal offers few, if any, serious options to respond to the intrusion" (para 17). "For as long as the Five Eyes continue to benefit from their own [supply chain / offensive] operations, it makes no sense to overreact to those intrusions" (para 26).

**Details**:

- The slogan wishfully means: "will now unleash hitherto locked-away offensive cyber capabilities that have previously been voluntarily foregone, and take the cyber fight to the adversary" (para 7).
- "Cybersecurity is not a subset of ‘cyber power’, and the aim of ‘cyber power’ is not cybersecurity". Cybersecurity is "about protection of everything online". Cyber power "is the protection of national security from *any* type of threat [...] as well as the projection of state power *for any relevant policy goal* through cyber capabilities" (para 10, emphasis in original).
- "There is no reason why heightened offensive activity in these areas, which most Five Eyes countries are planning, would have any deterrent effect at all on hostile state hacking" (para 12).
- Narrow exceptions: direct attack on adversary infrastructure e.g. US against IRA pre-elections
- Assuming SolarWinds was SVR" "Even if [an attack against an "elite intelligence agency with expensive covert infrastructure and better operational security" was] successful, the SVR would regard such an attack as a setback, not a deterrent" (para 14)
- Recriprocity: in launching offensive ops against SVR, "the U.S. must realize it is saying that direct, destructive attack against intelligence agency infrastructure is acceptable conduct in cyberspace. That might be right, but it will cut both ways" (para 14)
- "Launching a so-called prerpositioning attack [...] —especially anything that disrupted or risked the lives of civilians—in response to an espionage operation would be an extraordinary decision: disproportionate, unethical, illegal, counterproductive and pointlessly escalatory" (para 16)
- So how do we respond? (1) Improve security. "Cybersecurity is fundamentally attritional. Hardening defenses doesn’t immunize against attack, but over the long haul it yields results" (para 20). 
- Albeit this doesn't fix SolarWinds. For that, ask about how technology markets work: "Why is it so hard to assess the quality of the security of providers? Why does insurance not provide the same incentive to improve security that it does in all sorts of other areas? Why is it that governments fail to spot the concentrated risk in the supply chain of single points of failure like SolarWinds, and act to mitigate that?" (para 21)
- (2) statecaft. "using the full range of government capabilities: economic, technical, legal and diplomatic" (para 22). e.g. Obama official Suzanne Spaulding notes that threats of sanctions, indictments, and diplomatic exposure brought China to the table in 2015, and led to an agreement that quietened Chinese activity for several years. Attribution inc exposing technical details of attacks.
- (3) a hard choice. "SolarWinds looks like a massive espionage operation; nothing more, nothing less. And [...] massive espionage operations are what the Five Eyes do better than anyone" (para 25). Reciprocity: FVEY can't define this as "inherently unacceptable unless it is prepared to face up to the consequences of that conclusion for the Five Eyes' own activites" (para 25). CM personally swore to making these sorts of arguments.
- "Whilst the U.S. (and by extension, its allies) has been *harmed* by the SolarWinds intrusions; there is no sense the U.S. has been *wronged* by them" (para 27).

**Directions**:

- Insurance industry influence
- On attribution: "But exposing and publishing the technical details of their attacks, as U.S. and U.K. led alliances have done on repeated occasions, blunts the effectiveness of these Russian operations. If you’re seriously interested in imposing costs that deter attackers, then putting the details of Russian attacks online render them useless in the future and allows victims to find compromises. It’s a seemingly dull but sometimes effective measure." (para 24).
