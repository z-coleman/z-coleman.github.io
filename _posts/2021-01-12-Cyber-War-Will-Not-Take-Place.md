**Precis**: "all past and present political cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of three activities that are as old as warfare itself: subversion, espionage, and sabotage. That is improbable to change in the years ahead" (p. 6).

**Method**: 

1. Applies Clausewitz's definiton of war to oestensibly cyber war case study events - a possible Siberian pipeline attack in 1982, Estonian DDoS 2007, Russia-Georgia dispute over South Ossetia 2008, Moonlight Maze in 1999. Finds them wanting.

Subsequently applies three offensive activites that are "neither crime nor war" (p. 20):

2. sabotage: Isreali Operation Orchard, possibly achieved via a kill switch embedded by contractor in Syrian air defence prior to bombing a reactor - presumably selected because Siberian pipeline may not have occurred. Suxnet.
3. espionage: Moonlight Maze (above) ,Titan Rain, alleged Chinese actions against DoD non-classified networks in 2003. Alleged Russian actions against DoD Secret-classified networks in 2008.
4. subversion: DDoS in Estonia and during Russia-Georgia (above). Anonymous' Project Chanology, targeting the Church of Scientology. HBGary Federal, a security company targeted after planning an announcement about their infiltrating Anonymous, inc data erasure, website defacement, posting CEO's social security number.

**Details**:

- "If the use of force in war is violent, instrumental, and political, then there is no cyber offense that meets all three criteria.  But more than that, there are very few cyber attacks in history that meet only *one* of these criteria" (p. 10).
- "Despite these trends the ‘war’ in ‘cyber war’ has more in common with the ‘war’ on obesity than with the World War II – it has more metaphoric than descriptive value. It is high time to go back to classic terminology and understand cyber offences for what they really are" (p. 15).
- "Only rarely do governments disclose information on successful cyber attacks on their systems. If they do, as some high-profile cases in the Pentagon illustrate, the amount of information released is not very deep" (p. 21).
- "Successful sabotage is primarily a function of the quality of the attacker’s technical sophistication and the available intelligence; successful subversion is primarily a function of the quantity of supporters mobilized by the strength of political ideas and social causes" (p. 27).

**Directions**: 

- On potential: "the one type of political offence with the greatest potential to unleash instability and violence may not be technologically highly sophisticated sabotage, but technically rather primitive subversion" (p. 27).
- On sophistication: "only very few sophisticated strategic actors may be able to pull off top-range computer sabotage operations" (p. 28).
- On defence: "but cyber defenses of the most sophisticated countries should be more transparently presented. Only openness and oversight can expose and reduce weaknesses in organization, priorities, technology, and vision" (p. 29).
- On attribution: "This article argued that the world never experienced an act of cyber war, which would have to be violent, instrumental, and – most importantly – politically attributed" (p. 29).
- On military integration: "But the question is if a trend is leading to inevitable acts of stand-alone cyber war, with code as the main weapon, not as an auxiliary tool that is nice to have" (p. 29).
