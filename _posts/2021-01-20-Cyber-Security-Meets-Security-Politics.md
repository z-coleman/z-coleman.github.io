### Cyber security meets security politics: Complex technology, fragmented politics, and networked science

[doi](https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1678855)

**Year**: 2020

**Authors**: Myriam Cavelty and Andreas Wenger (Both ETH)

**Summary**: Where we are at (spheres, factors, clusters, challenges) , and could be going.

**Details**:

- IR or security studies theory "is no longer as rare" in cybersecurity research (p. 6)
- Most articles in the special issue draw on a post-positivist research tradition
- Beyond the state: "The state is not the only important actor in this space – rather, it is at the intersection between state and non-state actors, nationally and internationally, that the specificities of cyber security politics emerge." (p. 6)
- "We claim that [cyber security politics research] should not be conceptualized as a sub-field of anything, so that inquiry is not overly restricted by the disciplining power of disciplines" (p, 6)
- "In sum, cyber security is at the same time moving upwards in the political agenda and expanding sideways as a problem area to a multitude of additional policy domains" (p. 7)
- Common ground: (1) digital technologies use and misuse, and (2) negotiation processes defining acceptable rules of behaviour

| Technology | Development and Use of Digital Technologies | Technologies are shaped by political ideas and power structures and shape the possibilities of political action in turn |
|            | Key Events (cyber-related)                  | Events outside the cyber realm with influence on cyber security politics and events from the cyber realm in the form of cyber incidents |
| Politics   | International (Power) Politics              | Belief in new sources of power (“cyber power”) and patterns of cooperation and conflict between great powers |
|            | Domestic Politics                           | Potentially conflictual negotiation processes about roles and responsibilities for state institutions, economy, and society (nationally and internationally) |
| Science    | Academic Debates                            | Broader ontological and epistemological trends that shape the discipline of International Relations and Security Studies |

- On attribution in the abstract: "Between the initial effect in the machine and the political effect lies a knowledge production process that creates an incident embedded in a specific social context. A technical effect needs to be discursively linked to something with sufficient social or political value to become security politically relevant – which also explains why only some cyber incidents reach that stage while others do not" (p. 11)
- On limits: "Incidents are also linked to another fundamental issue in the study of cyber security: the availability of data. Our current knowledge about cyber security relies heavily on data from commercial threat reporting and news reports. Yet this data provides a partial and biased view of cyber threat activity, because it is often politicized and influenced by the demands of powerful buyers and the interests of capable providers" (p. 11)
- On international power politics: "This highlights questions of cooperation and conflict, about the formation of alliances and the maintenance of strategic stability, about the proliferation and control of dual-use technologies, but also about the efforts of states to come to international agreements in the form of norms and institutions" (p. 12)
- On academic debates: "The biggest cleft exists between problem-solving theories and critical theories" (p. 12)
- On empirical trends: "First, attention is shifting from theoretical “doomsday” cyber attack scenarios towards the reality of persistent (low-level) cyber operations in different types of conflict settings. Second, attention has partially shifted to targeted cyber attacks. Third, and as a corollary of growing unease about the destabilizing role of cyber operations, state and non-state actors are more actively searching for ways to control the risk of escalation and conflict through different means" (p. 14)
  - 3b. "An important precondition for upholding the credibility of both cyber norms and cyber deterrence is the (sometimes public) attribution of cyber incidents to a politically responsible actor" (p. 17)

**Directions**:

- Clusters of Research
  - The reality of cyber conflict - explaining state restraint and practices: "characterized by a reevaluation of the threat based on empirical evidence and a gradual application and adaption of “old” IR and strategic studies concepts to cyber security" (p. 18)
  - Moving inside and beyond the state: "Three partially overlapping approaches – linked to markets, norms, and governance – have emerged that all reflect a realization that the development of digital technologies is only partially influenced by states and political considerations" (p. 19). e.g. attribution by private firms, attribution as norm-setting.
  - Securitization, practice, and assemblages: "By focusing on non-traditional actors and aspects of politics, this type of research is able to make invisible aspects of cyber security visible" (p. 22) e.g. Stevens examines Symantec on Stuxnet.
- Future
  - "AI [and quantum] will become an essential element of cyber security and will have a profound impact on the speed, scale, duration, autonomy, and complexity of cyber operations, for both offense and defense" (p. 23)
  - "we can expect that political and military actors will attempt to better understand the (limited) strategic utility of cyber operations below the level of armed conflict, in order to find the right balance between restraint and exploitation" (p. 23)
  - "no stable cyber governance framework will emerge without greater convergence on responsible behavior among great powers" (p. 23)
  - "How states decide to regulate their technology base is moreover directly linked to how they anticipate this will influence their relative economic, political, and military power at the international level" (p. 24)
- Challenges
  - "A first key challenge for cyber security politics research is conceptual and linked to the integration of theoretical knowledge from different disciplines and research traditions" (p. 24)
  - "A second key challenge or indeed an opportunity for cyber security politics research is linked to the fact that more data about cyber operations by many different actors around the world and better tools to monitor and analyze this data are becoming available. While there is room for theory development and theory testing, we will likely enter an era of empirical work" (p. 25)
  - "A third key challenge for cyber security politics research is linked to overcoming the institutional barriers that slow down its independent contribution to cyber security and cyber security politics" (p. 25)
